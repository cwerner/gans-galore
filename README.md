# GANs galore! 🕵️‍♂️🦹‍♂️
A collection of GANs for experimentation and study implemented with PyTorch

> This repo is a simple collection of GAN varieties to explore the possibilities of this model type.
> The models are set up to train on commom toy (image) datasets. The plan ist to eventually include
> time-series data to make this useful for work.

## Design principles
- Use pytorch-lightning and hydra for clean and modern model architectures
- Build a model hierarchiy to reuse as much code as possible between variants
